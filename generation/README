This folder contains the scripts used to generate the data files that
go in to the model. It does not contain the Kronos database at this point,
which will be required. This should be put in a folder "kronos" below this
one.

To create a new release:
copy a filemap file into the folder. This will be used for wavelengths, etc.
It will also be merged with AUTOSTRUCTURE data if there is insufficient high-n
data in the file.

There are some hardwired files and paths that need to be set. I will not go in
to these here. 

run the code for each ion:
python3 acx_process.py Z z1 Donorsym
e.g.
python3 acx_process.py 6 5 H
